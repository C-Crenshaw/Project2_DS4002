## Description

MI3 deliverable for the second project cycle of DS 4002. <br />

The objective of this project is to build a Python image recognition model which can sufficiently analyze image data produced by grocery store chains, hypothesizing that an accurate model will be able to identify the products within each image and generate a reasonable total price for a given basket of items. This project group will attempt to fulfill this objective by answering the following questions: To what extent does the image recognition model accurately determine the grocery products within a given image? Will the similarity of appearance between some grocery items obscure their identification? How can data generated from check-out cameras be used to learn more about customer preferences and even track revenue generation? The overall success of the constructed model will be calculated in order to apply the model to more complex images of multiple products, simulating a customerâ€™s purchasing behavior at checkout.
