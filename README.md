## Description

MI3 deliverable for the second project cycle of DS 4002. <br />

The objective of this project is to build a Python image recognition model which can sufficiently analyze image data produced by grocery store chains, hypothesizing that an accurate model will be able to identify the products within each image and generate a reasonable total price for a given basket of items. This project group will attempt to fulfill this objective by answering the following questions: To what extent does the image recognition model accurately determine the grocery products within a given image? Will the similarity of appearance between some grocery items obscure their identification? How can data generated from check-out cameras be used to learn more about customer preferences and even track revenue generation? The overall success of the constructed model will be calculated in order to apply the model to more complex images of multiple products, simulating a customer’s purchasing behavior at checkout. 

## Contents of the Repository

The contents of this repository include the source code, data, figures, license, and references for MI3. 

## [SRC](https://github.com/C-Crenshaw/Project2_DS4002/tree/fc050f93dcebb51567d5ef2890a21deff47ea505/SRC)

This section contains all the source code for the project. All code has been consolidated in one python/jupyter notebook file. The original source code can be found [online](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14-p9glhQ1IrUiko6xtq0YeYRt7nQd3yb?usp=sharing). 

### Installing/Building Code

* The code can be downloaded from the SRC folder in either python or Jupyter Notebook format. The finalized and most updated version of the code file can be found online on Google Colaboratory. The link to this file is shared above.

### Usage

The usage section focuses on the most complex aspects of the final code, highlighting the most important aspects of the final code. A supplemental documentation of the code usage can be found in the SRC folder on the main repository page. 

* This section describes key steps for setting up the development environment and code projects specifically to use Object Detector. All necessary imports are loaded into the 'P2_Source_Code.py' file. These necessary packages are repeated below. These imports include those standard to most Python projects and the MediaPipe packages utilized for the construction and testing of an Object Detection model. 
```
#Standard imports
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from google.colab import files

#Install MediaPipe library
!pip install mediapipe

#Image displaying imports
import cv2
from google.colab.patches import cv2_imshow

#Object detection imports
import mediapipe as mp
from mediapipe.tasks import python
from mediapipe.tasks.python import vision

#Filepath for downloaded MediaPipe "EfficientDet-Lite2 (int8)" model
model_path = "/content/efficientdet_lite2.tflite"
```

* The object detection function of the code operates on image data with a machine learning (ML) model, accepting static data as input and outputting a list of detection results. Each detection result represents an object that appears within the image. For images with a single object, the detection results are appended into a data table which clearly illustrates the accuracy of the model. The following codeblock demonstrates the process of feeding the model images by manually selecting files from a computer drive. Once the files have been uploaded, the code creates a function for outlining and displaying the detected objects in an image and stores the detection results of the function in a dataframe. The final accuracy dataframe is then displayed and exported.
```

        flag = True
        #If confidence is greater than or equal to 75%, object is considered detected
        if detection.categories[0].score >= 0.75:

        else:

  if flag == False:
    row = [IMAGE_FILE,objectName,"No",np.nan,np.nan]

  #Append row to accuracy df
  accuracyDF.loc[len(accuracyDF)] = row

```

* For images with multiple objects, the detection results are not appended into a data table. Instead, the code displays an annotated image result that illustrates whether the model successfully identified the grocery objects in the image. 
```

#Select all images from computer files

  content = uploaded[filename]

  filenames.append(filename)

#Load the input image

#Detect objects in the input image
detection_result = detector.detect(image)

#Display the detection result

annotated_image = visualize(image_copy, detection_result)
rgb_annotated_image = cv2.cvtColor(annotated_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

```

## [Data](https://github.com/C-Crenshaw/Project2_DS4002/tree/e08487d3cf52566ae0569532b7cabfeb587244f9/DATA)

This section contains all of the data for this project. The data dictionary is provided below. Relevant notes about use of data are also included. 

The original dataset used for this project was built by the project group. The photos within the dataset were taken by Team Leader Carson Crenshaw and were subsequently compiled for use within this project. The assemblage of this dataset was modeled after the [Grocery Store DataSet](https://github.com/marcusklasson/GroceryStoreDataset.git) built by @marcusklasson. This data was foundational to research presented at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 2019 Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision. The published research by Klasson, Zhang, and Kjellstrom (2020) contains a collection of numerous pictures of grocery store items taken on a smartphone camera in different locations. While the images used are original, the image file structure used in Project 2 is adapted from the aforementioned dataset.  

The "Grocery Item Photos" folder above includes six sub-folders: "apple," "orange," "banana," "broccoli," "carrot," and "group." With respect to the first five folders, these contain the images used to test the image detection capabilities of the model on images with single items. The final folder, "group," is used to test the image detection capabilities of the model on images with multiple items. 

The model can be tested on other images outside the ones used for this project, but they must be in a .jpeg file format. 

The file structure used in the project is modeled below. For brevity, only the master folder "Grocery Item Photos" and the sub-folder "apple" folder/dataset will be illustrated here.

**Grocery Item Photos**
| 	Column Name	 | 	Description	 | 	Data Type	 |  
| 	:-----:	 | 	:-----:	 | 	:-----:	 |
| 	apple	| 	Single item images of apples	| 	Folder	 | 
| 	orange	| 	Single item images of oranges	| 	Folder	 | 
| 	banana	| 	Single item images of bananas	| 	Folder	 | 
| 	broccoli	| 	Single item images of broccoli	| 	Folder	 | 
| 	carrot	| 	Single item images of carrots	| 	Folder	 | 
| 	group	| 	Multiple item images of grocery products; images featuring multiple of the single produce items (apple, orange, banana, broccoli, carrot)	| 	Folder	 | 

**apple**
| 	Column Name	 | 	Description	 | 	Data Type	 |  
| 	:-----:	 | 	:-----:	 | 	:-----:	 |
| 	apple_01	| 	Single item image of an apple	| 	JPEG	 | 
| 	apple_02	| 	Single item image of an apple	| 	JPEG	 | 
| 	apple_03	| 	Single item image of an apple	| 	JPEG	 | 
| 	apple_04	| 	Single item image of an apple	| 	JPEG	 |  
| 	apple_05	| 	Single item image of an apple	| 	JPEG	 | 

The other sub-folders utilized in this project follow the same orientation as the apple dataset shown above. They are each a folder filled with sample images of their respective grocery item to be used in the testing of an image detection model. 

The final dataset "accuracy.csv" is assembled at the conclusion of the image detection model for single item images. This dataset details the accuracy for each test run on each image. 

**accuracy.csv**
| 	Column Name	 | 	Description	 | 	Data Type	 |  
| 	:-----:	 | 	:-----:	 | 	:-----:	 |
| 	File Name	| 	Name of image file used	| 	String	 | 
| 	Object	| 	Name of object detected in the file	| 	String	 | 
| 	Detected?	| 	Has the object in question been detected?	| 	Binary (Yes/No)	 | 
| 	Confidence	| 	Numerical quantification of object detection model accuracy	| 	Float	 |  
| 	Accepted?	| 	 Is the confidence value greater than or equal to 75%?	| 	Binary (Yes/No)	 |
