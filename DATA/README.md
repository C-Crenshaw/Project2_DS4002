# Data for Project 2

The original dataset used for this project was built by the project group. The photos within the dataset were taken by Team Leader Carson Crenshaw and were subsequently compiled for use within this project. 


The assemblage of this dataset was modeled after the [Grocery Store DataSet](https://github.com/marcusklasson/GroceryStoreDataset.git) built by @marcusklasson. This data was foundational to research presented at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 2019 Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision. The published research by Klasson, Zhang, and Kjellstrom (2020) contains a collection of numerous pictures of grocery store items taken on a smartphone camera in different locations. While the images used are original, the image file structure used in Project 2 is adapted from the aforementioned dataset.  


The "Grocery Item Photos" folder above includes six sub-folders: apple, orange, banana, broccoli, carrot, and group. With respect to the first five folders, these contain the images used to test the image detection capabilities of the model on images with single items. The final folder, "group," is used to test the image detection capabilities of the model on images with multiple items. 


The model can be tested on other images outside the ones used for this project, but they must be in a .jpeg file format. 


This process is extensively noted in the repository README.md file.
